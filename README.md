# Here i have created a micro project in java 
# In which i have implemented most of OOP concepts
# I have noted down each evry step i.e why how what for understanding of myself.which are messy XD
# i have learnt for each loop for interating through ArrayList 
# implementation of collections
# implemetnation of abstract classes and abstract methods
# method ovverrind
# Creating variables of classe type i.e if i have employee class and i want to make and var of it 
# ex.Employee employee ,emp1,emp2 etc
# i learnt that classes can be used as structure which we used in C language
# to make user defined datatypes
